# DNSMAP
`dnsmap` is a tool used for DNS enumeration and brute-forcing subdomains. It helps in gathering information about a target domain by discovering subdomains. Here's a brief overview of common `dnsmap` commands and examples:

### Installation
If `dnsmap` is not already installed on your Kali Linux, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install dnsmap
```

### Basic Usage
The general syntax for using `dnsmap` is:

```bash
dnsmap [options] <domain>
```

### Common Commands and Examples

1. **Basic Subdomain Enumeration**
   To enumerate subdomains of a domain, use:

   ```bash
   dnsmap example.com
   ```

2. **Using a Custom Wordlist**
   If you have a custom wordlist, specify it with the `-w` option:

   ```bash
   dnsmap -w /path/to/wordlist.txt example.com
   ```

3. **Verbose Output**
   For more detailed information during the scan, use the `-v` option:

   ```bash
   dnsmap -v example.com
   ```

4. **Specify DNS Server**
   To use a specific DNS server for the queries, use the `-r` option:

   ```bash
   dnsmap -r 8.8.8.8 example.com
   ```

5. **Output to a File**
   To save the results to a file, use the `-o` option:

   ```bash
   dnsmap -o output.txt example.com
   ```

6. **Brute-Force Mode**
   To enable brute-forcing, you can set a timeout with the `-t` option (timeout in seconds):

   ```bash
   dnsmap -t 2 -w /path/to/wordlist.txt example.com
   ```

### Example Scenarios

- **Finding Subdomains with Default Wordlist:**
  ```bash
  dnsmap example.com
  ```

- **Using a Custom Wordlist and Saving Results:**
  ```bash
  dnsmap -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -o results.txt example.com
  ```

### Summary
`dnsmap` is a versatile tool for DNS enumeration. Using the options effectively allows you to customize the scan according to your needs. Always ensure you have permission to perform such scans on the target domain.

  DNSMap is a DNS reconnaissance tool that can be used to gather information about a target domain's DNS infrastructure. Here are some common DNSMap commands and examples on Kali Linux:

**Basic Usage**

`dnsmap <domain_name>`

Example: `dnsmap google.com`

This command will perform a basic DNS reconnaissance on the specified domain, including resolving the domain to IP addresses, identifying mail servers, and detecting potential subdomains.

**Options**

* `-r` or `--recursive`: Perform a recursive DNS scan, which can help identify more subdomains.

Example: `dnsmap -r google.com`

* `-s` or `--subdomains`: Only scan for subdomains, without performing a full DNS reconnaissance.

Example: `dnsmap -s google.com`

* `-m` or `--mx`: Only scan for mail servers (MX records).

Example: `dnsmap -m google.com`

* `-n` or `--no- recursion`: Disable recursive DNS scanning.

Example: `dnsmap -n google.com`

* `-t` or `--threads`: Specify the number of threads to use for the scan.

Example: `dnsmap -t 10 google.com`

* `-o` or `--output`: Save the output to a file.

Example: `dnsmap google.com -o output.txt`

**Advanced Usage**

* `dnsmap -r -s -m google.com`: Perform a recursive DNS scan, scan for subdomains, and identify mail servers.
* `dnsmap -n -t 5 google.com`: Perform a non-recursive DNS scan, using 5 threads.
* `dnsmap -o output.txt google.com`: Save the output to a file named "output.txt".

**Other Examples**

* `dnsmap -r -s -m -t 10 google.com`: Perform a comprehensive DNS reconnaissance on google.com, using 10 threads.
* `dnsmap -n -s -m microsoft.com`: Perform a non-recursive DNS scan on microsoft.com, scanning for subdomains and mail servers.

**Tips and Tricks**

* Use the `-r` option carefully, as it can generate a large amount of traffic and may cause issues with the target domain.
* Use the `-t` option to adjust the number of threads according to your system's resources and the target domain's size.
* Use the `-o` option to save the output for later analysis or to use as input for other tools.
* DNSMap can be used in conjunction with other tools, such as Nmap or Dig, to gather more comprehensive information about a target domain.

Remember to always use DNSMap and other reconnaissance tools in a legal and ethical manner, and to respect the target domain's privacy and security.

DNSmap is a tool used in Kali Linux for subdomain enumeration, primarily used by pentesters during the information gathering phase. It works by brute-forcing subdomains using a built-in wordlist or a user-supplied wordlist.

Here's a breakdown of common `dnsmap` commands and examples:

**Basic Usage**

*   **`dnsmap <target-domain>`**: This command uses dnsmap's built-in wordlist to find subdomains for the specified target domain. For example: `dnsmap targetdomain.foo`

**Options**

*   **`-w <wordlist-file>`**:  Specifies a custom wordlist file to use for brute-forcing. If you don't provide this option, DNSMAP will use the default file. Example: `dnsmap targetdomain.foo -w wordlist.txt`
*   **`-r <regular-results-file>`**: Saves the results to a text file. If you only provide a path, dnsmap will create a unique filename with a timestamp. Example: `dnsmap targetdomain.foo -r /tmp/`
*   **`-c <csv-results-file>`**: Saves the results in CSV format. Example: `dnsmap targetdomain.foo -c /tmp/results.csv`
*   **`-d <delay-millisecs>`**:  Sets a delay in milliseconds between DNS requests. This can be useful to avoid interfering with your own internet connection or to avoid triggering rate limiting on the target's DNS servers. The delay value is a *maximum* random value. Example: `dnsmap targetdomain.foo -d 300` (sets a maximum delay of 0.3 seconds).
*   **`-i <ips-to-ignore>`**:  Filters out false positives by ignoring specific IP addresses.  Example: `dnsmap targetdomain.foo -i 10.55.206.154,10.55.24.100`

**Examples**

*   **Subdomain bruteforcing using a user-supplied wordlist and saving the results:**

    `dnsmap targetdomain.foo -w wordlist.txt -r /tmp/domainbf_results.txt`
*   **Subdomain bruteforcing with a delay, saving results in regular and CSV format, filtering IPs, and using a user-supplied wordlist:**

    `dnsmap targetdomain.foo -d 800 -r /tmp/ -c /tmp/ -i 10.55.206.154,10.55.24.100 -w ./wordlist_TLAs.txt`

**Important Notes**

*   `dnsmap` is intended for use during the information gathering/enumeration phase of security assessments.
*   It's a good practice to use the `-d` option to add delays between requests, especially if you experience bandwidth issues.
*   Be aware that `dnsmap` relies on brute-forcing, so it may produce false positives if the target domain uses wildcards.

                                             ALTERNATIVES
The `dnsmap` tool is a DNS enumeration and network reconnaissance tool that can be used to gather information about a target domain. Here are some common `dnsmap` commands and examples on Kali Linux:

1. **Perform a basic DNS enumeration**:
   ```
   dnsmap target.com
   ```
   This command will perform a basic DNS enumeration on the target domain `target.com`.

2. **Specify a wordlist for subdomain discovery**:
   ```
   dnsmap target.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
   ```
   This command will use the specified wordlist (`/path/to/wordlist.txt`) to perform subdomain discovery on the target domain.

3. **Enable verbose output**:
   ```
   dnsmap target.com -v
   ```
   This command will provide more detailed output, including the IP addresses associated with each discovered subdomain.

4. **Perform a zone transfer**:
   ```
   dnsmap target.com -z
   ```
   This command will attempt to perform a zone transfer on the target domain, which can reveal additional information about the domain's DNS configuration.

5. **Specify a custom DNS server**:
   ```
   dnsmap target.com -d 8.8.8.8
   ```
   This command will use the specified DNS server (`8.8.8.8`) instead of the default system DNS server.

6. **Save the results to a file**:
   ```
   dnsmap target.com -o results.txt
   ```
   This command will save the enumeration results to the file `results.txt`.

7. **Bypass robot.txt restrictions**:
   ```
   dnsmap target.com -b
   ```
   This command will bypass the `robots.txt` file, which may otherwise prevent `dnsmap` from accessing certain subdomains.

8. **Perform a brute-force attack on a specific subdomain**:
   ```
   dnsmap target.com -s subdomain.target.com
   ```
   This command will perform a brute-force attack on the specific subdomain `subdomain.target.com`.

These are just a few examples of the `dnsmap` commands you can use on Kali Linux. Remember to use these tools responsibly and only on domains you have permission to test.
